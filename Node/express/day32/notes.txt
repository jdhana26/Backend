 
## 2. Difference between Node and Express

**Node.js**

* A **runtime environment** that lets you run JavaScript outside the browser.
* Used to build servers and backend applications.

Example:

```js
console.log("Server running");
```

**Express.js**

* A **framework built on Node.js**.
* Makes building servers and APIs easier.

👉 In short:

* **Node = engine**
* **Express = toolkit to build faster**

---

## 3. What is `.env`?

A `.env` file stores **environment variables** (secret or configurable values).

Example:

```
PORT=5000
DB_PASSWORD=abc123
```

Why use it?

* Keeps **sensitive data safe**
* Avoids hardcoding values in code

---

## 4. What is `listen()`?

`listen()` starts the server and tells it to wait for requests.

Example:

```js
app.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log("Server running");
});
```

Meaning:

> “Start the server on port 5000.”

---

## 5. What is Express?

Express is a **Node.js framework used to create servers and APIs easily**.

Example:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
```

---

## 6. Why do we use Express?

Because it makes backend development easier.

Without Express:

* More code
* Hard routing
* Manual handling

With Express:

* Simple routing
* Middleware support
* API creation is easy

---

## 7. What is nodemon?

`nodemon` automatically **restarts the server when you save changes**.

Install:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

Run:

```bash
nodemon app.js
```

No need to restart server manually.

---

## 8. What is port number and localhost?

**Port number**

* A communication endpoint for a server.
* Example: `5000`, `3000`

**localhost**

* Refers to **your own computer**.

Example:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

Meaning:

> Server running on your machine at port 5000.

---

## 9. What is API?

API = **Application Programming Interface**

It allows **frontend and backend to communicate**.

Example:

```js
app.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.send("User data");
});
```

---

## 10. Flow of Express + Frontend

The flow looks like this:

```
User → Frontend → API request → Express server → Database
                        ↓
                     Response
                        ↓
                     Frontend UI
```

Example flow:

1. User clicks button
2. Frontend sends request (fetch/axios)
3. Express receives request
4. Server processes data
5. Response sent back
6. UI updates

---

## 11. What is `package.json`?

`package.json` is the **project configuration file**.

It contains:

* project name
* dependencies
* scripts
* version

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "myapp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
```

Created using:

```bash
npm init -y
```
