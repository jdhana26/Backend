Okay — I’ll explain each one **simply and clearly**, one by one.

---

## 1. What is API?

**API = Application Programming Interface**

An API is a **bridge between two software programs** so they can talk to each other.

Example:

* Your **frontend (React)** sends a request
* Your **backend (Node/Express)** sends data back

Example API:

```
http://localhost:5000/users
```

Frontend asks → Backend responds with data (usually JSON).

Think of API like:

> A **waiter in a restaurant** — takes your order and brings food.

## 2. What is Route Handling?

Route handling means:

> **What should happen when a user visits a specific URL.**

Example:

```js
app.get('/home', (req, res) => {
  res.send("Welcome Home")
})
```

Here:

* `/home` = route
* function = handler

So when user visits `/home`, server sends **"Welcome Home"**.

---

## 3. What is Route Mounting?

Route mounting means:

> **Connecting route files to the main server using `app.use()`**

Example:

**authRoutes.js**

```js
router.get('/login', handler)
```

**server.js**

```js
app.use('/api', authRoutes)
```

Final route becomes:

```
/api/login
```

So mounting = **attaching routes to the app**.

---

## 4. What is CORS?

**CORS = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**

It allows **frontend and backend running on different ports or domains to communicate**.

Example:

* React → `localhost:3000`
* Node → `localhost:5000`

Without CORS → blocked by browser
With CORS → allowed

Example:

```js
import cors from 'cors'
app.use(cors())
```

---

## 5. What is JSON parse?

You typed **json pharse**, but correct term is **JSON.parse()**.

`JSON.parse()` converts:

> **JSON string → JavaScript object**

Example:

```js
const data = '{"name":"Dhana"}'
const obj = JSON.parse(data)

console.log(obj.name)
```

Output:

```
Dhana
```

Reverse method:

```
JSON.stringify()
```
