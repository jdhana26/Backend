2. What is HTTP module? Why do we use it?

The HTTP module is a built-in Node.js module used to:

Create web servers

Handle requests and responses

Build APIs

Serve web pages

Example:

const http = require("http");

Why we use it:

To communicate between client and server

To build backend applications

To handle HTTP requests

3. What are import and export methods?

Import/export is used to share code between files.

Instead of writing everything in one file, we split code into modules.

There are two systems in Node:

CommonJS
require()
module.exports
ES Modules
import
export

Modern Node mostly uses ES Modules.

5. What is machine and runtime environment in Node?

Machine (in Node.js)

A machine is the physical computer or system where Node.js runs.

It includes:

CPU

Memory (RAM)

Operating System (Windows / Linux / Mac)

Example:
Your laptop running Node.js is the machine.

Runtime Environment (in Node.js)

A runtime environment is the software layer that executes JavaScript code.

In Node.js, the runtime environment is Node itself.

Node.js provides:

V8 engine → runs JavaScript

File system access

Network access

HTTP server capability

So JavaScript can run outside the browser.
